## Ivan, Xinyu, Elaine, Daniel

## Announcements
Note: The event and user database is stored in Parse which will be retired as of January 28, 2017. There are no plans to update Nearby NY, so the application will not function poperly after that date.

## Description
### Motivation
Nearby NY was originally conceived as part of a summer program held by the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship that supported student teams developing mobile applications for New York City students.
### Usage
Nearby NY is a platform aiming to provide high school students with sources of events in New York to connect with each other. It is a curated list of events catered to students in the city - it is explicitly meant to allow people to share the events they go to and connect to strangers who share the same interests. Unlike other event websites, it isn't just meant to share information with the people you know - it encourages meeting others and finding new events to explore.

## Development
Technologies used include:
- HTML, CSS, MaterializeCSS for UI design
- Javascript and jQuery for front-end functionality
- APIs include Facebook for login and Parse for storage
- PhoneGap/Cordova was used to hook into native Android functality and create the .apk

## Deployment
This repository contains the .apk file for Nearby NY, as well as the PhoneGap project used to build the apk file. Download the .apk, upload it to your phone, run the file on your phone, and the Nearby NY app should be installed.
